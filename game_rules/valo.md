## Map Bans
Map Picking System for the Best of 3 will rely on a [random generator](https://www.mapban.gg/en/ban/valorant/all). 

- 1st Game - Random Map
- 2nd Game - Defeated Team’s Choice
- 3rd Game - Defeated Team’s Choice

One map ban for each team.

## Guidelines
- We discourage using the voice chat on Valorant to prevent any unnecessary voice pings for the benefits of both teams.
- Team Captains must agree on the time to prevent any misunderstandings. All players must be ready at least 10 minutes before the game as courtesy to both teams.
- For the side, a [virtual toss coin](https://g.co/kgs/4p5JX4) will be used on the first round and the winning team will decide on their side if they’re attacking or defending on the first round.
- Maximum of **2 TIMEOUTS** for both teams. To request for pause, chat `TO` on all chat and state the reason afterwards.
